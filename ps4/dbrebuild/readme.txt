PS4 DB Rebuilder for firmware v9.00.

Hi Guys!

Just a quick update to the DB Rebuilder for PS4 Jailbreak.
This update is for version 9.00 and connects to port 2121.

Full credit goes to Zer0xFF for creating this script in the
first place. I really needed to find something and this is the
only one I found to restore my DB. Unfortunately, the table
schema changed and a number of columns were added.

This is not a proper release but it worked for me. Adding nulls
to random columns in the table is certainly not the way to go but
since it worked for me and I was able to recover my fake package
game menu items after rebuilding the DB, I'm putting it out there
for anyone who might come across needing to do this.

Maybe there is one already and I did not see it!


Thanks to Zer0xFF
